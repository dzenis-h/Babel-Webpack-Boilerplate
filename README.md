## Overview 👀

Babel-Webpack-Boilerplate is a simple and easy-to-use starter kit for web development projects. It uses Babel to transpile modern JavaScript code into a version that is compatible with older browsers, and Webpack to bundle and optimize the code for production. It also supports hot module replacement, code splitting, and tree shaking.
